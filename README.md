### Projects

I'm currently building a backend that tracks remote work hours with NestJS, and perfecting a capacity planning algorithm for an [ordering app](https://github.com/magdaundisz/order-up/blob/main/README.md) I built for a local restaurant. 

Before software I studied photography and worked as a journalist in Tbilisi. Examples of my work can be seen in a [portfolio](https://github.com/magdaundisz/Photography-Portfolio) I built with Gatsby, and on an [instagram clone](https://github.com/magdaundisz/aperture) that hosts photography on Firebase.
