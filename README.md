## Background

I‚Äôve taken a non-traditional path to software engineering. With a background in art and photography, I worked as a photojournalist and editor in Tbilisi, Georgia. I flew back to the States in early 2020... and then Covid hit.

I've spent the last two years self-studying software engineering, with an emphasis on the frontend. I‚Äôve studied React, [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), Javascript/Typescript, and recently started learning backend development with [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest). I‚Äôm excited about programming and looking forward to joining a great team where I can contribute while furthering my development.

Located in Seattle, WA but open to relocation.
