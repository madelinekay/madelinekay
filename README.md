## Projects

### Artist Portfolio

As a first project I built a Gatsby static site to display artist portfolios across devices. The app leverages Gatsby-image plugin for fluid, responsive images in photo-reel, modals, and carousels. Built with **React**, **Javascript**,  **Material UI**, and **GatsbyJS**.

### Order-Up

Order-Up is a restaurant order tracker I built for a local restaurant. For the app I engineered an algorithm for stove usage optimization, reducing take-out wait times by 50% through enhanced capacity. Built with **React**, **Javascript**, **Next.js**, **Material UI**, and **Firebase**.
